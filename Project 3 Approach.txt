My task is to write code that parses the "userlog.log" file and generates automated parts.

First I will parse the text file into a list and use 4 functions.
I will then have functions iterate through the list to search for the conditions (suspicious activities, irresponsible behaviors, system glitches, domain counts). 
Data that goes with each index is always the same number of indices apart.
Each function outputs a text file report.
